Project: Gogo Firmware

Purpose:
This project combines ROS2 robotics software and Arduino firmware to control and monitor the Gogo system.

Source Structure:
- ROS2 workspace: /home/sjs/gogo/ros2_ws
  Contains ROS2 nodes, launch files, and utilities.
- Arduino firmware: /home/sjs/gogo/firmware
  Contains embedded firmware for motor control, sensors, and serial communication.

Development Notes:
- ROS2 nodes are primarily Python and follow standard ROS2 style conventions.
- Firmware is in C++ (Arduino) and follows modular, small-function design.
- Unit tests and simulation may exist in separate folders (not included in daily prompt).

Guidelines for ChatGPT:
- Focus on assisting with today's work in this project.
- Provide suggestions, code reviews, and guidance.
- Only make changes when specifically requested.
- Respect the separation between ROS2 and firmware code.
- Keep explanations concise but clear for understanding project context.
